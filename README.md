# Meshi
Meshi is a non-lightweight C++ library for DDS-XTypes serialization and deserialization, and not fast, but aim to be easy to use. It supports C++11 and later standards.

Our goal is to provide a simple and easy-to-use API for DDS-XTypes serialization and deserialization for Non-DDS applications.

# Goal

- [ ] Support CDR Serialization and Deserialization with TypeObject in DDS-XTypes specification.
	- [ ] Support CDR 1
		- [ ] Support Primitive Types
		- [ ] Support Sequence Types
		- [ ] Support Array Types
		- [ ] Support Structure
		- [ ] Support Union
		- [ ] Support Nullable
		- [ ] Support Alias
	- [ ] Support CDR 2
		- [ ] Support Primitive Types
		- [ ] Support Sequence Types
		- [ ] Support Array Types
		- [ ] Support Structure
		- [ ] Support Union
		- [ ] Support Nullable
		- [ ] Support Alias
- [ ] Support for both Dynamic Types and Static Types.
